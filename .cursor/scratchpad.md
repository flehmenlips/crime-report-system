# CrimeReport - Birkenfeld Farm Theft Police Report Website

## Background and Motivation
This project involves creating a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly web application for presenting stolen items from the Birkenfeld farm theft. The website will serve law enforcement, investigators, attorneys, and other stakeholders by providing organized access to detailed item information, evidence, and documentation.

The application must handle sensitive data appropriately, provide robust search functionality, and ensure secure access to confidential information. The use of Next.js with TypeScript will ensure type safety and performance, while Cloudinary integration will provide efficient media management and delivery.

## Lessons
- Always verify file existence before attempting to read/edit
- Use absolute paths for consistency in tool calls
- Follow security best practices for sensitive data handling
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- **FIXED**: Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin moved to separate package (@tailwindcss/postcss)
- **FIXED**: Next.js 15 no longer requires experimental.appDir configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Node.js modules (fs, path) cannot be used in client components - use API routes instead
- **NOTE**: Always check Next.js version compatibility when setting up new projects
- **BEST PRACTICE**: Use API routes for server-side operations, fetch from client components
- **JSX SYNTAX**: Use proper function body syntax and Fragment (`<>`) for complex conditional rendering in map functions
- **FIXED**: JSX conditional rendering syntax error in ItemTable component by using function body syntax instead of implicit return
- **LESSON**: When conditional rendering in map functions, use explicit function bodies and Fragment syntax for reliable JSX structure
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side environment variables
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF works well for text-based reports but has limitations with images/media
- **Modal Design**: Use fixed positioning with proper z-index for overlay components
