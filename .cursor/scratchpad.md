# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user is preparing to provide this Crime Report application to law enforcement for their specific case. They have requested a comprehensive review of the codebase to assess:
1. **Security practices** - particularly authentication, password management, and credential security
2. **Industry best practices** - are we using proper security standards?
3. **Readiness for law enforcement** - is the application production-ready and professional?
4. **Vulnerabilities** - what security issues need to be addressed?

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED**

#### **1. PASSWORDS STORED IN PLAIN TEXT** ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity: CRITICAL**
- **Location**: `src/lib/auth-server.ts` line 64, `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` line 111
- **Issue**: Passwords are stored as plain text in the database
- **Code**: 
  ```typescript
  // Line 64 in auth-server.ts
  if (user.password !== password) {
    console.log('‚ùå Password mismatch for user:', username)
    return null
  }
  
  // Line 111 in register/route.ts
  password, // In a real app, you'd hash this
  ```
- **Impact**: If database is compromised, ALL user passwords are exposed
- **Law Enforcement Risk**: This is a liability for chain of custody and evidence integrity

#### **2. NO PASSWORD HASHING LIBRARY**
**Severity: CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: No bcrypt, argon2, or scrypt in dependencies
- **Current**: Direct string comparison of passwords
- **Required**: Industry-standard password hashing (bcrypt with salt)

#### **3. WEAK SESSION MANAGEMENT**
**Severity: HIGH**
- **Location**: `src/lib/auth-server.ts` lines 119-127
- **Issue**: User object stored directly in cookie (7-day expiration)
- **Problem**: No session revocation capability, no refresh tokens
- **Better**: Session IDs in cookies, session data in database with ability to invalidate

#### **4. EXCESSIVE DEBUG LOGGING**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Location**: Throughout authentication files
- **Issue**: Detailed auth logs could expose sensitive info in production
- **Example**: `console.log('Attempting to authenticate user:', username)`
- **Fix**: Remove or gate behind development mode

#### **5. WEAK PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Location**: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` line 46
- **Current**: Minimum 6 characters only
- **Law Enforcement Standard**: Should require:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
  - No dictionary words
  - Password strength meter

#### **6. NO RATE LIMITING IMPLEMENTATION**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Documentation** claims rate limiting exists (README.md line 271, 278)
- **Reality**: No actual rate limiting library or implementation found
- **Risk**: Brute force attacks on login endpoint
- **Required**: Implement actual rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit, upstash/ratelimit)

#### **7. NO AUDIT LOGGING**
**Severity: HIGH for Law Enforcement**
- **Issue**: No audit trail for:
  - Login attempts (failed and successful)
  - Data access (who viewed what evidence)
  - Evidence modifications
  - Administrative actions
- **Law Enforcement Need**: Chain of custody requires detailed audit logs

#### **8. CSRF PROTECTION NOT VISIBLE**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: No obvious CSRF token implementation
- **Risk**: Cross-site request forgery attacks
- **NextAuth**: Should provide this but isn't being used for main auth

#### **9. NO INPUT SANITIZATION LIBRARY**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: No DOMPurify, validator.js, or sanitization library in dependencies
- **Current**: Relying on Prisma's parameterized queries (good) but no HTML/XSS sanitization
- **Risk**: Stored XSS in text fields (descriptions, notes, etc.)

#### **10. CLOUDINARY CREDENTIALS IN LOGS**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Potential**: API keys could be logged during debugging
- **Fix**: Sanitize all environment variable logging

### ‚úÖ **GOOD SECURITY PRACTICES FOUND**

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Proper multi-tenancy with tenant-based data filtering
2. **Prisma ORM**: Prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Well-implemented permission system
4. **Security Headers**: Good CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc. in `src/middleware/security.ts`
5. **HTTPOnly Cookies**: Sessions use httpOnly flag (good)
6. **Secure Cookies in Production**: Secure flag enabled for HTTPS
7. **Email Verification**: Required before account activation
8. **Authorization Checks**: Consistent tenant/role checks on API routes
9. **Environment Variables**: Properly excluded from version control (.gitignore)
10. **HTTPS Ready**: Proper configuration for production HTTPS

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Question for User**:
1. Do you want me to implement ALL critical security fixes immediately?
2. Is there a timeline for when law enforcement needs this?
3. Should I prioritize certain fixes over others?
4. Do you have access to the production database to migrate existing passwords?

**Recommendations**:
1. **BEFORE showing to law enforcement**: We MUST implement password hashing (Task 1.1) and audit logging (Task 1.3)
2. **Timeline**: If urgent, focus on Phase 1 (critical fixes) only first
3. **Password Migration**: Existing users will need to reset passwords after hash implementation
4. **Testing**: Each security fix needs thorough testing before deployment

## Lessons

### Security Best Practices for Law Enforcement Applications
1. **Chain of Custody**: Audit logs are not optional - they're required for evidence integrity
2. **Password Security**: Plain text passwords are never acceptable, especially for sensitive applications
3. **Compliance**: Law enforcement applications may have specific regulatory requirements (CJIS, etc.)
4. **Professional Standards**: Security documentation is as important as security implementation
5. **Access Control**: Tenant isolation is critical - we have this right
6. **Data Integrity**: Every modification should be logged with timestamp and user

### Technical Lessons
1. **Never store plain text passwords** - Always use bcrypt/argon2/scrypt
2. **Audit logging is not optional** for law enforcement/legal applications
3. **Security headers are good** but not sufficient alone
4. **Rate limiting must be implemented**, not just documented
5. **Session management** should allow for revocation and monitoring
