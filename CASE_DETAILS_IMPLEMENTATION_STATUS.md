# 🏛️ Case Details System - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 1)

### Database Schema
- ✅ **CaseDetails** model with tenant isolation
- ✅ **CaseTimelineEvent** for chronological events
- ✅ **CaseSuspect** for suspect tracking
- ✅ **CaseEvidence** for evidence documentation
- ✅ **CaseUpdate** for case progress notes
- ✅ **CasePermission** for granular user access control
- ✅ Database migration applied to production

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/case-details` - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with permission checking
- ✅ `/api/case-details/timeline` - POST, PUT, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/case-details/suspects` - POST, PUT, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/case-details/evidence` - POST, PUT, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/case-details/updates` - POST, PUT, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/case-details/permissions` - POST, DELETE

### Components
- ✅ **CaseDetailsView** - Read-only view with tabs
  - Overview, Timeline, Suspects, Evidence, Updates tabs
  - Permission-based visibility
  - Professional UI matching app design
  - Loading and error states

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Phase 2)

### Components Needed:
1. **CaseDetailsForm** - Create/Edit form for property owners
   - Multi-step wizard for case creation
   - Timeline event management
   - Suspect management
   - Evidence documentation
   - Update management

2. **Integration** - Add to dashboards
   - Property Owner: Create/Edit/View case
   - Law Enforcement: View and add updates
   - Other Stakeholders: View with permissions

3. **Permission Management UI**
   - Grant/revoke access to specific users
   - Select which stakeholders can view case details

## 📋 TODO (Phase 3)

### Priority Tasks:

#### 1. Create CaseDetailsForm Component
```typescript
// Features:
- Create new case with all details
- Edit existing case (owner only)
- Add/edit/delete timeline events
- Add/edit/delete suspects
- Add/edit/delete evidence entries
- Add updates (owner + law enforcement)
- Form validation
- Auto-save drafts
```

#### 2. Property Owner Dashboard Integration
```typescript
// Add button: "Create Case Report"
// Shows form modal
// After creation, shows in Case Details button
```

#### 3. Update StakeholderDashboard
```typescript
// Replace old CaseDetails component
// Use new CaseDetailsView
// Add permission check before showing button
```

#### 4. Permission Management UI
```typescript
// In CaseDetailsForm:
- Section for granting access
- List current users with access
- Toggle view/edit/delete permissions
- Remove access button
```

#### 5. Law Enforcement Features
```typescript
// Allow law enforcement to:
- Add case updates
- Update case status (open/investigating/closed)
- Update assigned officer
- Add timeline events
// But NOT edit core case info
```

## 🎯 User Stories

### As a Property Owner:
- ✅ I need database storage for my case details
- ✅ I can view my case details in a professional layout
- ⏳ I can create a new case report with full details
- ⏳ I can edit my case report at any time
- ⏳ I can grant specific stakeholders access to view my case
- ⏳ I can see who has access to my case

### As Law Enforcement:
- ✅ I can view case details if granted permission
- ✅ API supports me adding updates
- ⏳ I can add investigation updates to the case
- ⏳ I can update case status and priority
- ⏳ I can add timeline events from my investigation
- ⏳ I cannot edit the original case description

### As Other Stakeholders (Broker, Banker, etc.):
- ✅ I can view case details if explicitly granted permission
- ✅ API enforces permission checks
- ⏳ I receive notification when granted access
- ⏳ I see view-only interface (no edit buttons)

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Permission Model:
```
Property Owner:
  - Full CRUD on their own cases
  - Can grant permissions to others
  - Can revoke permissions

Law Enforcement:
  - Can add updates, change status
  - Cannot edit core case details
  - Cannot delete cases

Other Stakeholders:
  - View-only (with permission)
  - Can request additional access
```

### Data Flow:
```
1. Property Owner creates case via CaseDetailsForm
2. Case saved to database with creator permissions
3. Owner grants view permission to stakeholders
4. Stakeholders see Case Details button
5. Law enforcement adds investigation updates
6. Everyone with permission sees updates in real-time
```

## 📊 Progress: 45% Complete

- [x] Database schema (100%)
- [x] API endpoints (100%)
- [x] View component (100%)
- [ ] Form component (0%)
- [ ] Dashboard integration (0%)
- [ ] Permission management UI (0%)

## 🚀 Next Actions:

1. **Create CaseDetailsForm** with wizard interface
2. **Add "Create Case Report"** button to Property Owner dashboard
3. **Integrate CaseDetailsView** into both dashboards
4. **Test end-to-end flow**:
   - Property owner creates case
   - Property owner grants permission to law enforcement
   - Law enforcement adds update
   - Both see the update
5. **Add permission management UI**

## 📝 Notes:

### Design Decisions:
- Case tied to tenant, not individual items
- One case per incident (not per item)
- Timeline tracks ALL events, not just theft
- Suspects can have multiple per case
- Evidence separate from item evidence (different purpose)
- Updates are chronological case progress notes

### Future Enhancements:
- Link stolen items to case
- Auto-generate timeline from item dates
- Export case report as PDF
- Email notifications on case updates
- Case templates for common scenarios
- Bulk permission grants (e.g., all law enforcement)
