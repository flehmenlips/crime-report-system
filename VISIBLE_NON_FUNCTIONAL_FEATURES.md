## 🎯 Feature Implementation Strategy

### **Multi-Perspective Development Approach**

For each feature, follow this process:

1. **Role Requirements Analysis**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Investigation tools for law enforcement
   const investigationFeatures = {
     law_enforcement: ['case_management', 'evidence_chain', 'collaboration'],
     insurance_agent: ['claims_assessment', 'valuation', 'documentation'],
     broker: ['market_analysis', 'valuation', 'sales_tracking']
   }
   ```

2. **Permission-Based Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Role-specific feature access
   const canAccessFeature = (user: User, feature: string) => {
     const roleFeatures = investigationFeatures[user.role] || []
     return roleFeatures.includes(feature)
   }
   ```

3. **Professional Context Integration**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Role-specific UI configuration
   const getProfessionalContext = (role: Role) => {
     switch (role) {
       case 'law_enforcement':
         return { workflow: 'investigation', tools: ['case_mgmt', 'evidence'] }
       case 'insurance_agent':
         return { workflow: 'claims', tools: ['assessment', 'valuation'] }
     }
   }
   ```
