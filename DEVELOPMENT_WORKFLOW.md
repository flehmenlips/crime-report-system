# ðŸš€ Development Workflow & Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for the Crime Report System, emphasizing the **multi-perspective architecture** and ensuring all user roles are considered during feature development.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Development Principles

### **1. Multi-Perspective First**
Every feature must be evaluated from **all user role perspectives**:
- Property Owners
- Law Enforcement
- Insurance Agents
- Brokers
- Bankers
- Asset Managers
- Support Staff (Assistant, Secretary, Manager, Executive Assistant)
- Super Administrators

### **2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Every feature must respect role permissions
- Consider tenant isolation requirements
- Implement proper access controls
- Test across all role types

### **3. Professional Context Awareness**
Each role has specific professional needs:
- **Law Enforcement**: Investigation tools, evidence chain of custody
- **Insurance Agents**: Claims assessment, valuation tools
- **Brokers**: Equipment valuation, market analysis
- **Bankers**: Risk assessment, collateral evaluation
- **Property Owners**: Personal documentation, evidence upload

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### **Step 1: Feature Planning**

Before writing any code:

1. **Define the Feature**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Which roles need this feature?
   - What are the business requirements?

2. **Role Impact Analysis**
   ```
   For each role, determine:
   - âœ… Can access this feature?
   - âœ… What permissions are needed?
   - âœ… How does it fit their workflow?
   - âœ… What data can they see/modify?
   ```

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Database changes needed?
   - New API endpoints required?
   - UI/UX considerations per role
   - Security implications

### **Step 2: Implementation**

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement with Role Awareness**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Role-based feature implementation
   const canUseFeature = (user: User) => {
     const allowedRoles = ['law_enforcement', 'insurance_agent']
     return allowedRoles.includes(user.role)
   }
   
   // In component:
   {canUseFeature(user) && <YourFeatureComponent />}
   ```

3. **Test Across Roles**
   - Test with different user types
   - Verify permissions work correctly
   - Ensure tenant isolation is maintained
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

### **Step 3: Review & Deploy**

1. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use descriptive title
   - Include role impact analysis in description
   - Tag relevant reviewers

2. **Preview Deployment**
   - Render automatically creates preview
   - Test in preview environment
   - Verify all roles work correctly

3. **Merge to Main**
   - After approval and testing
   - Deploys to production automatically
   - Monitor for issues

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Guidelines

### **Role-Specific Design**

Each role should have:
- **Appropriate color schemes** (defined in role configs)
- **Relevant icons and branding**
- **Professional context** in titles and descriptions
- **Role-appropriate workflows**

### **Consistent Patterns**

- **Navigation**: Consistent across roles
- **Data tables**: Same sorting/filtering patterns
- **Forms**: Consistent validation and error handling
- **Modals**: Same interaction patterns
- **Loading states**: Consistent across all features

### **Accessibility**

- **Keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader compatibility**
- **High contrast mode** support
- **Mobile responsiveness** for all features

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Guidelines

### **Role-Based Security**

1. **Permission Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Always validate permissions server-side
   export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
     const user = await getCurrentUser(request)
     if (!hasPermission(user, 'read:items')) {
       return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 })
     }
     // ... rest of handler
   }
   ```

2. **Tenant Isolation**
   ```typescript
   // Always filter by tenant for property owners
   const items = await prisma.stolenItem.findMany({
     where: {
       tenantId: user.tenantId, // Ensure tenant isolation
       ...otherFilters
     }
   })
   ```

3. **Data Validation**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize user-generated content
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement rate limiting

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

### **Role-Based Metrics**

Track usage by role:
- Feature adoption rates
- Error rates per role
- Performance metrics
- User satisfaction

### **Performance Monitoring**

- API response times
