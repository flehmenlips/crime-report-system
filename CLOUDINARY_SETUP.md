# 📸 Cloudinary Setup Guide - Real Photo Management

## 🎯 **Current Status**

Your Crime Report System is working with **demo mode** for photo management. To enable real photo uploads and display, you need to configure Cloudinary.

### **Why Photos Aren't Displaying:**
- ✅ **Evidence API working**: Files are being uploaded and stored in database
- ✅ **Upload system working**: File upload API is functional
- ❌ **Cloudinary not configured**: Using placeholder credentials
- 🎨 **Demo images showing**: Mock thumbnails for visual reference

## 🚀 **Setup Real Cloudinary Integration**

### **Step 1: Get Cloudinary Account**
1. **Visit** [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. **Sign up** for a free account (generous free tier)
3. **Go to Dashboard** after signup
4. **Copy your credentials**:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key  
   - API Secret

### **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**

Replace the placeholder values in your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Cloudinary credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
```

### **Step 3: Restart Development Server**

```bash
# Kill current server
pkill -f "next dev"

# Restart with new credentials

```
