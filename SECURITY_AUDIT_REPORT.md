# üîí Security Audit Report - Crime Report System
## Prepared for Law Enforcement Readiness Review

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Version**: 1.3.0  
**Auditor**: AI Security Review  
**Purpose**: Pre-law enforcement deployment security assessment

---

## üìä Executive Summary

### Overall Security Posture: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

**Current State**: The application has good architecture and several strong security practices, but contains **critical vulnerabilities that MUST be fixed before presenting to law enforcement**.

### Key Findings:
- ‚úÖ **3 Critical Issues** requiring immediate remediation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **4 High-Priority Issues** that should be addressed
- üìã **3 Medium-Priority Recommendations** for best practices

### Recommendation:
**DO NOT present to law enforcement until Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) is complete.**

---

## üö® CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Passwords Stored in Plain Text** 
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL - MUST FIX**  
**CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)

**Description:**
Your application currently stores all user passwords in plain text in the database. This is visible in:
- `src/lib/auth-server.ts` (line 64): Direct password comparison
- `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (line 111): Plain text storage with comment "In a real app, you'd hash this"

**Impact:**
- If database is compromised, ALL user passwords are immediately exposed
- Law enforcement data could be accessed by attackers
- Chain of custody for evidence is compromised
- **Legal Liability**: This violates basic security standards and could make evidence inadmissible

**Real-World Example:**
```typescript
// CURRENT (INSECURE):
if (user.password !== password) {  // Plain text comparison
  return null
}

// SHOULD BE:
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashedPassword)
if (!isValid) {
  return null
}
```

**Fix Required:**
- Install bcrypt library: `npm install bcrypt @types/bcrypt`
- Hash all passwords on registration with salt
- Verify passwords using bcrypt.compare()
- Migrate existing passwords (users must reset)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for implementation + user password reset

---

### 2. **No Audit Logging System**
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL for Law Enforcement**  
**Legal Risk**: High

**Description:**
The application has NO audit trail for:
- Who accessed what evidence and when
- Failed and successful login attempts
- Modifications to case data
- Evidence uploads and deletions
- Administrative actions

**Impact:**
- **Chain of Custody**: Cannot prove who accessed evidence
- **Legal Admissibility**: Evidence without audit trail may be inadmissible in court
- **Security Incidents**: Cannot investigate unauthorized access
- **Compliance**: Fails law enforcement data handling standards (CJIS, etc.)

**Fix Required:**
- Create `AuditLog` database table
- Log all authentication events (success/failure, IP, timestamp)
- Log all evidence access (view, download, modify)
- Log all case modifications with before/after values
- Provide audit log export for law enforcement

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours for full implementation

---

### 3. **Excessive Debug Logging in Production**
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH - Security Information Disclosure**  

**Description:**
The authentication system logs sensitive information that could be exposed in production:
```typescript
console.log('Attempting to authenticate user:', username)
console.log('‚ùå Password mismatch for user:', username)
console.log('User found in database:', { username: user.username, role: user.role })
```

**Impact:**
- Usernames exposed in logs
- Authentication patterns revealed
- Role information disclosed
- Could aid attackers in reconnaissance

**Fix Required:**
- Remove all authentication debug logs from production
- Use environment-gated logging: `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')`
- Sanitize all log output

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Address Soon)

### 4. **No Rate Limiting Implementation**
**Risk Level**: üü° **HIGH - Brute Force Vulnerable**

**Description:**
While your README claims rate limiting exists ("5 login attempts per 15 minutes"), there is **no actual rate limiting code** in the application.

**Impact:**
- Login endpoint vulnerable to brute force attacks
- API endpoints can be overwhelmed
- No protection against credential stuffing attacks

**Fix Required:**
- Install rate limiting library (e.g., `@upstash/ratelimit` or `express-rate-limit`)
- Implement login endpoint protection (5 attempts per 15 min)
- Implement API rate limiting (100 requests per minute)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### 5. **Weak Password Requirements**
**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Current**: Only 6 characters minimum  
**Law Enforcement Standard**: 12+ characters with complexity requirements

**Fix Required:**
- Increase minimum to 12 characters
- Require: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Add password strength meter to registration UI
- Check against common password lists

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### 6. **Insecure Session Management**
**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Description:**
Entire user object is stored in cookie (7-day expiration). No ability to:
- Revoke sessions remotely
- Force logout on password change
- Implement "logout all devices"
- Track active sessions

**Fix Required:**
- Store only session ID in cookie
- Store session data in database with expiration
- Add session revocation capability
- Add "active sessions" management UI

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

---

### 7. **No Input Sanitization Library**
**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM**

**Description:**
While Prisma prevents SQL injection, there's no protection against:
- Stored XSS in descriptions, notes, comments
- HTML injection in text fields
- Script injection in user-generated content

**Fix Required:**
- Install DOMPurify or similar: `npm install dompurify @types/dompurify`
- Sanitize all user-generated HTML before storage
- Escape output in display components

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## ‚úÖ STRONG SECURITY PRACTICES (Keep These!)

### What You're Doing Right:

1. **‚úÖ Tenant Isolation**: Excellent implementation of multi-tenancy with proper data filtering
   - Every query filters by `tenantId`
   - Super admin and law enforcement roles can access all tenants
   - Property owners see only their data

2. **‚úÖ Prisma ORM**: Prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
   - All database queries use Prisma's type-safe API
   - No raw SQL concatenation
   - Input is properly escaped

3. **‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Well-designed permission system
   - Clear role definitions (property_owner, law_enforcement, super_admin)
   - Granular permissions (read:own, write:all, admin:users, etc.)
   - Consistent authorization checks on API routes

4. **‚úÖ Security Headers**: Comprehensive CSP and security headers
   - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection
   - Content Security Policy configured
   - HSTS for HTTPS connections

5. **‚úÖ HTTPOnly Cookies**: Session cookies use httpOnly flag
   - Prevents JavaScript access to session cookies
   - Secure flag enabled in production

6. **‚úÖ Email Verification**: Required before account activation
   - Prevents spam registrations
   - Verifies user identity

7. **‚úÖ Environment Variable Security**: Properly excluded from version control
   - `.env` files in `.gitignore`
   - No secrets committed to repository

8. **‚úÖ HTTPS Ready**: Proper configuration for production SSL/TLS
   - Secure cookies in production
   - HSTS header when HTTPS detected

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS (Best Practices)

### 8. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
**Priority**: Medium (Recommended for law enforcement accounts)

**Benefits:**
- Adds extra layer of security for sensitive accounts
- Industry standard for law enforcement systems
- Prevents account takeover even if password is compromised

**Implementation Options:**
- Time-based OTP (TOTP) with Google Authenticator
- SMS verification codes
- Email verification codes

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### 9. **Security Monitoring and Alerting**
**Priority**: Medium

**Recommended:**
- Error monitoring (Sentry or similar)
- Failed login attempt alerts
- Unusual activity detection
- Real-time security event notifications

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for basic setup

---

### 10. **Legal and Compliance Documentation**
**Priority**: High for Law Enforcement

**Required Documents:**
- **Terms of Service**: Legal agreement for system use
- **Privacy Policy**: How data is collected, used, stored
- **Evidence Handling Policy**: Chain of custody procedures
- **Data Retention Policy**: How long data is kept, deletion procedures
- **Security Policy**: Security measures and incident response

**Estimated Time**: 4-8 hours (may require legal review)

---

## üîê SPECIFIC CODE CHANGES REQUIRED

### **Critical Fix #1: Password Hashing**

**Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install bcrypt
npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt
```

**Create Password Utility** (`src/lib/password.ts`):
```typescript
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'

const SALT_ROUNDS = 12 // Higher = more secure but slower

export async function hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS)
}

export async function verifyPassword(
  password: string, 
  hashedPassword: string
): Promise<boolean> {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword)
}
```

**Update Registration** (`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`):
```typescript
import { hashPassword } from '@/lib/password'

// Line 111 - BEFORE:
password, // In a real app, you'd hash this

// Line 111 - AFTER:
password: await hashPassword(password),
```

**Update Authentication** (`src/lib/auth-server.ts`):
```typescript
import { verifyPassword } from '@/lib/password'

// Lines 63-68 - BEFORE:
// Check password (in a real app, you'd compare hashed passwords)
if (user.password !== password) {
  console.log('‚ùå Password mismatch for user:', username)
  return null
}

// Lines 63-68 - AFTER:
// Verify password hash
const isValidPassword = await verifyPassword(password, user.password)
if (!isValidPassword) {
  // Don't log details in production
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.log('‚ùå Password verification failed for user:', username)
  }
  return null
}
```

---

### **Critical Fix #2: Audit Logging**

**Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
```prisma
model AuditLog {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId      String?  // Null for failed logins
  action      String   // 'login', 'logout', 'view_evidence', 'modify_case', etc.
  resource    String?  // 'evidence:123', 'case:456', etc.
  details     Json?    // Additional context
  ipAddress   String?
  userAgent   String?
  timestamp   DateTime @default(now())
  success     Boolean  @default(true)
  
  @@index([userId])
  @@index([action])
  @@index([timestamp])
  @@index([resource])
}
```

**Audit Service** (`src/lib/audit.ts`):
```typescript
import { prisma } from './prisma'

export async function logAudit({
  userId,
  action,
  resource,
  details,
  ipAddress,
  userAgent,
  success = true
}: {
  userId?: string
  action: string
  resource?: string
  details?: any
  ipAddress?: string
  userAgent?: string
  success?: boolean
}) {
  await prisma.auditLog.create({
    data: {
      userId,
      action,
      resource,
      details: details ? JSON.stringify(details) : null,
      ipAddress,
      userAgent,
      success,
      timestamp: new Date()
    }
  })
}
```

**Usage Example** (in login route):
```typescript
import { logAudit } from '@/lib/audit'

// After successful login:
await logAudit({
  userId: user.id,
  action: 'login',
  ipAddress: request.ip,
  userAgent: request.headers.get('user-agent'),
  success: true
})

// After failed login:
await logAudit({
  action: 'login_failed',
  details: { username },
  ipAddress: request.ip,
  userAgent: request.headers.get('user-agent'),
  success: false
})
```

## üéì SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT APPLICATIONS

### Chain of Custody Requirements:
1. **Every action must be logged** - who, what, when, where
2. **Logs must be tamper-proof** - append-only, timestamped
3. **Evidence integrity** - hashes/checksums of uploaded files
4. **Access control** - who can view/modify evidence
5. **Audit trail export** - for court proceedings

### Compliance Considerations:
- **CJIS Compliance**: Criminal Justice Information Services Security Policy
- **GDPR/Privacy**: Data protection and user rights (if applicable)
- **Evidence Rules**: Admissibility standards for digital evidence
- **Data Retention**: Legal requirements for how long to keep data

### Professional Standards:
- **Documentation**: Every security measure must be documented
- **Incident Response**: Plan for security breaches
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and security patches current
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **User Training**: Law enforcement users need security training

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Review this report** with your team
2. **Prioritize fixes** based on law enforcement timeline
3. **Backup your database** before making changes
4. **Implement Phase 1** critical fixes
5. **Test thoroughly** in development environment
6. **Deploy to production** after testing
7. **Document all security measures** for law enforcement

### Questions to Consider:
- **Timeline**: When do you need to present to law enforcement?
- **Existing Users**: How will you handle password migration?
- **Compliance**: Any specific law enforcement requirements (CJIS, etc.)?
- **Budget**: Are you able to upgrade hosting for security features?
- **Support**: Do you need ongoing security maintenance?

---

## üìÑ CONCLUSION

Your Crime Report System has a **strong foundation** with excellent architecture and many good security practices. However, the **critical vulnerabilities (especially plain text passwords)** must be fixed before presenting to law enforcement.

### Summary:
- **‚úÖ Strong**: Tenant isolation, RBAC, Prisma ORM, security headers
- **üö® Critical**: Password hashing, audit logging, debug logs
- **‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority**: Rate limiting, session management, input sanitization
- **üìã Recommended**: 2FA, monitoring, legal documentation

### Final Recommendation:
**Implement Phase 1 (8-12 hours)** before law enforcement review. The application will then meet basic security standards and demonstrate professional development practices.
